Leo is a detail-oriented Project Manager who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. A custom painter by trade, Leo is equally talented applying custom finishes as he is directing the work. Leo excels on projects that require close coordination with hotel operations where a schedule is measured in hours, not days. Leo has owned his own paint company for years but jumps on board with us, as we need, to assist in sizeable projects. Leo has a knack for landing nearly anywhere in the United States and immediately being an incredible source of manpower, supplies, and subcontractors for any of our jobs.
