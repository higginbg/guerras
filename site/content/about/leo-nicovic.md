Leo is a detail-oriented Project Manager who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. A custom painter by trade, Leo is equally talented applying custom finishes as he is directing the work. Leo excels on projects that require close coordination with hotel operations where a schedule is measured in hours, not days. Leo has owned his own paint company for years but jumps on board with us as we have the need to assist in sizeable projects. Leo has a knack for being able to land nearly anywhere in the United States and immediately be an incredible source of manpower, supplies, and subcontractors for any of our jobs. Leo's ability to add to the team that we already bring to the table is a very important part of our success.
