      text: I started serving tables 5 years ago at Red Lobster in Salem, I became the service manager in late 2018 and for the past two years we were able to bring our restaurant from 126th to number 14th in the world out of 715 locations! In June of 2020 Greg and Fran Guerra offered me the dream position of General Manager of their new restaurant right here in Silverton! I’m so grateful for this new opportunity with new friends. The team and I are very excited to show all of our guests an amazing experience with some of the best food and drinks in town!

      text: I was born in Virginia and grew up in Kentucky. I grew up in a family of great Southern cooks. My three passions are food, music, and Kentucky basketball (of course). I knew early on that I wanted to work with food. I was accepted into Sullivan University’s culinary program. But life and money happens and I graduated from Eastern Kentucky University with a Bachelor’s of Science in Exercise and Sports Science. I still worked in a grocery store, restaurants, and ran one of the food programs at the local YMCA to help put myself through school. I moved to Oregon about 15 years ago, with a brief stint in Williamsburg, VA. I hope to reintroduce people how to eat clean, healthy, and make food soulful again.
